        "# Q1: What is python,and why is it popular?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: Python is high-level interpreted programming language discovered in the year 1991.And it is popular because python is widely used programming language in data industry, in automation, in image processing,and have a lots of libraries.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q2: What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes the Python code line by line.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "# Q3: What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: Keywords are predefined words that hold a special meaninng and have specific purpose in python. Also, keywords cannot be used as variable.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "# Q4: Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because all the keywords are used to create logic.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "# Q5: What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: objects whose value can be changed after they are created are known as mutable objects. OR with the help of mutability we can change or edit any element in the list.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "# Q6: Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: both the data structure are ordered  collection but lists are designed to be flexible hence it is mutable, on the other hand, tuples are designed to represent fixed. Thus, it is immutable.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q7: What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: In python, \"==\" and \"is\" operators both used to compare objects and acts differently. The \"==\" operator is equality comparison and \"is\" operator is identity comparison.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q8: What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: there are total three logical operators in python:\n",
        "     1. AND\n",
        "     2.OR\n",
        "     3.NOT\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "# Q9:  What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: The process of changing the data type of a value is known as type casting.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "# Q10: What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\"\"\"Ans: The main difference between implicit and explicit type casting is;\n",
        " the implicit is automatic  type conversion and explicit is manual type conversion.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "# Q11: What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: Conditional statements helps us to code decisions based on some pre-conditions.\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "# Q12: How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
        "Ans: if we want to execute multiple conditions then we use elif statement,also elif statement allows to check multiple conditions sequentially.\n",

        "# Q13: What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\"\"\"\n",
